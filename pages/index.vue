                Alex O'Keeffe, a swarthy young gentleman from the leafy suburbs
                of Hanwell was no ordinary little boy. With his oversized
                cranium, bottomless stomach and amiable personality, young Alex
                was always popular, well loved and revered by friends and family
                alike. Fast forward 28 years, several countries travelled,
                thousands of beers chugged, dozens of gigs danced at, and dozens
                of swipes on a little app called Bumble, he matches with his
                future wife, Ceri, and the rest, they say, is history.

                Ceri Skelton, a beautiful young woman from the village of
                Crowthorne, was no ordinary little girl. With her white as snow
                complexion, dream of being a tooth fairy as well as her
                thoughtful personality, young Ceri was well loved and revered by
                friends and family alike, even when she declared herself to be
                the late Esther Williams. Fast forward to the age of 26, having
                played at the Royal Albert Hall, travelled to Uganda and
                discovered a love for midwifery, loved 3 wonderful dogs in
                Gryff, Meg and Dylan, as well as dozens of swipes on a little
                app called Bumble, she matches with her future husband, Alex,

              On the 22nd July 2018 at the Griffin Pub in Caversham, Reading,
              Alex and Ceri had their first date which was over 7 hours long. It
              left the waiting staff wondering if they would ever leave the
              restaurant, the car parking inspectors no choice but to issue
              tickets and both Alex and Ceri with the sense that this first date
              was the start of something special. After two years together,
              Ceri's graduation as a midwife, 2 new jobs for Alex, a home
              together with Gryff and 1 global pandemic, Alex decided he liked
              it and put a ring on it.

                For weeks before the proposal, I had been floating the idea to
                Ceri about going for a walk somewhere that wasn't one of our
                usual walking locations. Having originally suggested Reigate
                Hill in Surrey, Boris, the spanner, went and put a spanner in
                the works the night before and declared Surrey out of bounds to
                us in tier 4. Luckily I had a backup location of Windsor and the
                long walk would make a perfect setting to pop the big question.

              >
                After what seemed like the longest walk of my life, and having
                had to make normal conversation along the way, we got to the top
                of the hill overlooking Windsor and the castle. We went to sit
                down and I poured some luke-warm hot chocolate ( I had forgotten
                to put the thermal lid back on the flask having been a bit
                preoccupied.. ). The plan had initially been to propose as we
                sat there, but as we had both Gryff and Meg (Ceri's mum's dog)
                with us, being able to sit for too long without barking and
                general mayhem was impossible. We started walking around the
                statue at the top of the hill and I started to realise we would
                soon be walking down again. In the mud at the top of Windsor's
                long walk, simultaneously, I dropped to one knee and asked (
                although might have came out as a whisper ) Ceri to marry me,
                Meg started barking, a mother shouted at her kids to 'look
                away', and the only words I cared about hearing, Ceri shouted
                back at me 'YES' before i had finished asking.

                This is just the best news and I've really been looking forward
                to dinner and being a ring bearer for my parents for a long time
                now. I like long walks on the beach and Mummy and Daddy. I've
                bought myself a bow tie for the occassion. If any squirrels or
                cats gatecrash the wedding I'll sort them out. And birds. I do
                hope there will be treats. and toys. It will be the best day.
